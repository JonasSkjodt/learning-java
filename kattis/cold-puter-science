/**
 * Problem C: Cold-puter Science
 * 
 * Input
 * The input is composed of two lines.
 * The first line contains a single positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) that specifies the number of temperatures
 * collected by the University of Chicago Weather Service. The second line contains  temperatures, each separated
 * by a single space. Each temperature is represented by an integer t (-1 000 000 <= t <=t 1 000 000)
 * 
 * Output
 * You must print a single integer: the number of temperatures strictly less than zero.
